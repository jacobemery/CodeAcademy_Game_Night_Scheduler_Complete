\f0\fs24 \cf0 I completed the project \'93Abruptly Goblins!\'94 for the \'93Learn Python 3\'94 course on Code Academy in Jupypter Notebook. This project works to find the optimal night of the week for a group of gamers to play the game \'93Abruptly Goblins!\'94 at a local store. After finding the optimal night, an email is sent to the available gamers. For those that are unavailable, a second game night is scheduled and emails are sent.}
