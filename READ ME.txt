I completed the project “Abruptly Goblins!” for the “Learn Python 3” course on Code Academy in Jupyter Notebook. This project works to find the optimal night of the week for a group of gamers to play the game “Abruptly Goblins!” at a local store. After finding the optimal night, an email is sent to the available gamers. For those that are unavailable, a second game night is scheduled and emails are sent.
